This is an updated portfolio describing my experience and highlighting some of my favorite projects. It includes a contact form which displays an error message when all fields are not filled out, an about section with a short description, and a projects page including 6 projects, their delployed links as well as their github links. The navbar directs user to these pages and there is also a footer which includes links to my github, linkedIn and openPowerlifting profiles. A screenshot of the app is in the public folder, since I still can't figure out how to make it display on here.
